# Smart-Python-Terminal
I am currently learning the python language, as it really interests me and therefore I decided to make a small project to familiarize myself with the basic syntax of the language. Keep in mind, this project is by no means complex but I personally think the best way to manifest knowledge is by creating small practical projects. Enjoy!

This project is a "Smart Python Terminal", as it uses the terminal but implements interesting features such as logging in into your account, adding accounts, creating and generating random numbers etc.

It also features an interesting color scheme, that makes it more readable.

IMPORTANT:
To use this application you need the basic login credentials, which are:
name = Lass
password = helloworld

Use /help once logged in to list the available commands, which are at your disposal.

Yours,

Lass
